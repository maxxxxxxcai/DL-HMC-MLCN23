# Abstract
Head movement during long scan sessions degrades the quality of reconstruction in positron emission tomography (PET) and introduces artifacts, which limits clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent deep learning-based motion correction work utilized raw PET list-mode data and hardware motion tracking (HMT) to learn head motion in a supervised manner. However, motion prediction results were not robust to testing subjects outside the training data domain. In this paper, we integrate a cross-attention mechanism into the supervised deep learning network to improve motion correction across test subjects. Specifically, cross-attention learns the spatial correspondence between the reference images and moving images to explicitly focus the model on the most correlative inherent information - the head region the motion correction. We validate our approach on brain PET data from two different scanners: HRRT without time of flight (ToF) and mCT with ToF. Compared with traditional and deep learning benchmarks, our network improved the performance of motion correction by 58% and 26% in translation and rotation, respectively, in multi-subject testing in HRRT studies. In mCT studies, our approach improved performance by 66% and 64% for translation and rotation, respectively. Our results demonstrate that cross-attention has the potential to improve the quality of brain PET image reconstruction without the dependence on HMT.
